        <h4>Hi! My name is Gu. You can find my art at <a href="http://instagram.com/gubean">IG</a> and at my  <a href="http://gubean.substack.com">newsletter doodle dump</a>. I like making art about the gift of connections and soft power. </h4>
        <h4>I'm hosting doodle sessions sometimes with guest artists during the pandemic (and possibly beyond!).<br> The sessions are free but if you enjoy the programming please consider venmoing <a href="http://venmo.com/gubean">@gubean</a> so I can pay guest artists and continue programming. </h4>
        <h4>Please consider joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/g7Cv9PmuGP">Discord</a> if you would like to share your art.</h4>
